# Non-Monetary Donation App - Front-End

## Overview

This project is a front-end implementation of a Non-Monetary Donation App created for the Software Engineering course. The primary goal is to facilitate non-monetary donations, such as clothes, food, medical supplies, and volunteer services (e.g., doctors and teachers). This app allows admins to manage organizations and donors, while donors can view and fulfill donation requests.

**Note: This project is only a front-end implementation with no back-end functionality and the website is not mobile responsive due to deadline time**
